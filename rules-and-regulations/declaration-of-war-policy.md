# 💣 Declaration of War Policy

### **Article 1: Declaration of War**

1. **Permitted War Types**: Within Koflum, recognized countries possess the right to declare various categories of war, including but not limited to nonviolent protests, protective actions, and violent conflicts.
2. **Approval Requirement**: Prior to the initiation of any war, the declaration must receive validation from a neutral third party, ensuring fairness and adherence to server rules.

### **Article 2: Conduct of War**

1. **Prohibited Actions**: Acts of aggression or warfare arising from personal grievances or malice are strictly forbidden. Such actions disrupt server harmony and violate the principles of fair play.
2. **Regulatory Oversight**: The Koflum Data Bureau (KDB) reserves the exclusive authority to investigate and determine the nature of any action deemed unlawful or inconsistent with the spirit of fair competition.

### **Article 3: Community Involvement and Disciplinary Actions**

1. **Jury and International Opinions**: Upon reviewing an incident, the KDB may consult a jury composed of server members or request input from other countries to gauge the appropriate level of disciplinary action.
2.  **Potential Penalties**: Depending on the severity and nature of the violation, consequences may include, but are not limited to:

    * Temporary server ban
    * Permanent server ban
    * Country-specific sanctions
    * Monetary fines imposed on the offending party
    * Restrictions on interacting with or accessing other countries within the Koflum server ecosystem

    This act seeks to balance the inherent competitive nature of the game with a framework that promotes respect, fairness, and constructive engagement among all Koflum countries.
