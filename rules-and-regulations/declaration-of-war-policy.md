# ðŸ’£ Declaration of War Policy

### **Article 1: Declaration of War**

1.1 Within Koflum, recognized countries possess the right to declare various categories of war, including but not limited to nonviolent protests, protective actions, and violent conflicts.

1.2 Prior to the initiation of any war, the declaration must receive validation from a neutral third party, ensuring fairness and adherence to server rules.

### **Article 2: Conduct of War**

2.1 Acts of aggression or warfare arising from personal grievances or malice are strictly forbidden. Such actions disrupt server harmony and violate the principles of fair play.

2.2 The Koflum Data Bureau (KDB) reserves the exclusive authority to investigate and determine the nature of any action deemed unlawful or inconsistent with the spirit of fair competition.

### **Article 3: Community Involvement and Disciplinary Actions**

3.1 Upon reviewing an incident, the KDB may consult a jury composed of server members or request input from other countries to gauge the appropriate level of disciplinary action.

3.2 Depending on the severity and nature of the violation, consequences may include, but are not limited to:

* Temporary server ban
* Permanent server ban
* Country-specific sanctions
* Monetary fines imposed on the offending party
* Restrictions on interacting with or accessing other countries within the Koflum server ecosystem

This act seeks to balance the inherent competitive nature of the game with a framework that promotes respect, fairness, and constructive engagement among all Koflum countries.
